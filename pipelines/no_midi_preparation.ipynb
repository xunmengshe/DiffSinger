    "\n",
    "## 1 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook will guide you to prepare your own dataset for DiffSinger with 44.1 kHz sampling rate.\n",
    "Please read and follow the guidance carefully, take actions when there are notice for <font color=\"red\">manual action</font> and pay attention to blocks marked with <font color=\"red\">optional step</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction to this pipeline and MIDI-less version\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline does not support customized phoneme dictionaries. It uses the [opencpop strict pinyin dictionary](../dictionaries/opencpop-strict.txt) by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "MIDI-less version is a simplified version of DiffSinger where MIDI layers, word layers and slur layers are removed from the data labels. The model uses raw phoneme sequence with durations as input, and applies pitch embedding directly from the ground truth. Predictors for phoneme durations and pitch curve are also removed. Below are some limitations and advantages of the MIDI-less version:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model will not predict phoneme durations and f0 sequence by itself. You must specify `ph_dur` and `f0_seq` at inference time.\n",
    "- Performance of pitch control will be better than MIDI-A version, because MIDI keys are misleading information for the diffusion decoder when f0 sequence is already embedded.\n",
    "- MIDIs and slurs does not need to be labeled, thus the labeling work is easier than other versions.\n",
    "- More varieties of data can be used as training materials, even including speech.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "These two hyperparameters refer to the width and the depth of the diffusion decoder network. Generally speaking, `384x20` represents a `base` model capacity and `512x20` represents a `large` model capacity. `384x30` is also a reasonable choice. Larger models consumes more GPU memory and runs slower at training and inference time, but they produce better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPU memory required for training:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base model - at least 6 GB (12 GB recommended)\n",
    "Large model - at least 12 GB (24 GB recommended)\n",

    "#### `test_prefixes`\n",
    "\n",
    "All files with name prefixes specified in this list will be put into the test set. Each time when a checkpoint is saved, the program will first run inference on the test set and put the result on the TensorBoard. Thus, you can listen to these demos and judge the quality of your model. If you add less than 10 test cases, more cases will be randomly selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `max_tokens` and `max_sentences`\n",
    "\n",
    "These two parameters jointly determine the batch size at training time, the former representing maximum number of frames in one batch and the latter limiting the maximum batch size. Larger batches consumes more GPU memory at training time. This value can be adjusted according to your GPU memory. Remember not to set this value too low because the model may not converge with small batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `lr` and `decay_steps`\n",
    "\n",
    "These two values refer to the learning rate and number of steps everytime the learning rate decays. If you decreased your batch size, you may consider using a smaller learning rate and more decay steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `val_check_interval`, `num_ckpt_keep` and `max_updates`\n",
    "\n",
    "These three values refer to the training steps between validating and saving checkpoints, the number of the most recent checkpoints reserved, and the maximum training steps. With default batch size and 5 hours of training data, 250k ~ 300k training steps is reasonable. If you decrease the batch size, you may increase the training steps.\n"
