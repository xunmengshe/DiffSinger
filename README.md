# Usage of Refactor Branch
This is a cleaner version of Diffsinger, which provides:
- fewer code: scripts unused in the DiffSinger are marked **\*isolated\***;
- better readability: many important functions are annotated (however, **we assume the reader already knows how the neural networks work**);
- abstract classes: the bass classes are filtered out into the "basics/" folder and are annotated. Other classes inherent from the base classes.
- better file structre: tts-related files are filtered out into the "tts/" folder, as they are not used in DiffSinger.

Getting Started:
1. Preprocessing
```sh
export PYTHONPATH=.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python data_gen/binarize.py --config configs/midi/cascade/opencs/aux_rel.yaml
```
2. Training
```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run.py --config configs/midi/e2e/opencpop/ds100_adj_rel.yaml --exp_name $MY_DS_EXP_NAME --reset  
```
3. Inference
```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run.py --config configs/midi/e2e/opencpop/ds100_adj_rel.yaml --exp_name $MY_DS_EXP_NAME --reset --infer
```

This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of our AAAI-2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02446), in which we propose DiffSinger (for Singing-Voice-Synthesis) and DiffSpeech (for Text-to-Speech).
