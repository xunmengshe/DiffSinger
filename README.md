# Usage of Refactor Branch
This is a cleaner version of Diffsinger, which provides:
- fewer code: scripts unused in the DiffSinger are marked **\*isolated\***;
- better readability: many important functions are annotated (however, **we assume the reader already knows how the neural networks work**);
- abstract classes: the bass classes are filtered out into the "basics/" folder and are annotated. Other classes inherent from the base classes.
- better file structre: tts-related files are filtered out into the "tts/" folder, as they are not used in DiffSinger.
- **(new) Much condensed version of the preprocessing, training, and inference pipeline**. The preprocessing pipeline is at 'preprocessing/opencpop.py', the training pipeline is at 'training/diffsinger.py', the inference pipeline is at 'inference/ds_cascade.py' or 'inference/ds_e2e.py'.

## Getting Started

### 0. Installation

```bash
# Install PyTorch manually (1.8.2 LTS recommended)
# See instructions at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# Below is an example for CUDA 11.1
pip3 install torch==1.8.2 torchvision==0.9.2 torchaudio==0.8.2 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/lts/1.8/cu111

# Install other requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1. Preprocessing

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python data_gen/binarize.py --config configs/midi/cascade/opencs/ds1000.yaml
```
### 2. Training

```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run.py --config configs/midi/cascade/opencs/ds1000.yaml --exp_name $MY_DS_EXP_NAME --reset  
```
### 3. Inference

```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run.py --exp_name $MY_DS_EXP_NAME --infer
```

This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of our AAAI-2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02446), in which we propose DiffSinger (for Singing-Voice-Synthesis) and DiffSpeech (for Text-to-Speech).
